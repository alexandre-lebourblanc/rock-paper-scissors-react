Hey do you want to play to a new game ?

The user can choose between two modes : Player vs Computer or Computer vs Computer

The winner of the first mode will be the first to reach the MAX_PVSC_SCORING

The winner of the second mode will be the first to reach the MAX_CVSC_SCORING, this mode is an automatic mode you have nothing to do except watching it.

At the end of each game, a new one is launched after a delay of 5 seconds.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the application in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches all the tests in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `conclusion`

Many other features or updates could have been done with more time like using Redux to manage a global store, add a scoring mode, add a 2 vs 2 Player, add some extensions like Lizard and Spock (code is ready for it, you juste have to update constants file for it) or adding an IA for the computer.

I hope this game will enjoy you as much it enjoyed me to develop it :)
